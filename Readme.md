## Welcome to the projet

Welcome to the SEIA surveillance drone project. 

Four students from Ynov Campus Bordeaux came up with the idea for this project and carried it out in partnership with Drone Inspiration in Poitier.


With this project, we want to offer a crowd-surveillance drone for demonstrations, social movements and sensitive meetings. 

The objective is to prevent crowds and overflow, and to intervene quickly and effectively to ensure order and safety. Counting people in a crowd in real time is also an asset for surveillance.


The project is divided into three parts:

1. Safety module for compliance with drone flight standards. [Here](/Module_Securote)

2. Artificial intelligence module to count people in real time. [Here](/Module_IA)

3. Ground station module to retrieve video and information from the drone in flight. [Here](/Module_Sol)



In every directory, you'll find a readme to help you and set up our solution.
